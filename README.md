<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

<img src="images/Screenshot.png" alt="screenshot">

CTU Recruits is a website that I developed as a 1st year college project in a timeframe of 2 days. 

The key features and requirements:
* A website for Employers to find and recruit Job Seekers
* A website for Job Seekers to create CV's and create a profile for Employer's to find

If I were to re-do this website, there is a whole lot of things that I would do better and 
differently, mainly just because of the extremely short timeframe that I had to work with
originally.

### Built With
These are the main frameworks and languages that I made use of in this project:
* [C#](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/)
* [ASP.Net Framework](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework)
* [MVC](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/aspnet/mvc)
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com)
